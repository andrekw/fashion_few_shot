* starting with omniglot dataset
** using oscar's repo's script for dataset prep 
- a bit tricky getting it to run, instructions were not clear
- just add his copyright
** prepare a data generator
- getting things in order was tricky, but i think my implementation is more efficient
- tf.data with keras is a pain, better use keras' native sequence stuff
